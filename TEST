To run the test suite using your current environment's Python interpreter and
packages, first make sure you have the testing dependencies installed:

    pip install -r requirements/test.txt

Then run:

    py.test

Optionally append `--cov passwords' for coverage output.

To run py.test against different combinations of Django and Python versions,
run:

    tox

Instead. Modify tox.ini to alter those combinations.
